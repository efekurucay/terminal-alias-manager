## 📋 Requirements

- **macOS 14.0** (Sonoma) or later
- **Xcode 15.2** or later
- **Swift 5.9**

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/efekurucay/terminal-alias-manager.git
cd terminal-alias-manager
```

### 2. Open in Xcode

```bash
open AliasManager.xcodeproj
```

### 3. Build & Run

Press **⌘R** in Xcode or run from the menu: **Product → Run**

The app will launch and automatically read your existing aliases from `~/.zshrc`.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project follows the **MVVM** (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern:

```
AliasManager/
├── AliasManagerApp.swift           ← App entry point & window config
├── AliasManager.entitlements       ← File access permissions
├── Assets.xcassets/                ← App icon & accent color
│
├── Models/
│   └── AliasItem.swift             ← Alias data model
│
├── Services/
│   └── ZshrcService.swift          ← Read/write/parse ~/.zshrc
│
├── ViewModels/
│   └── AliasViewModel.swift        ← Business logic, search, CRUD
│
└── Views/
    ├── ContentView.swift           ← Main screen (NavigationSplitView)
    ├── AliasRowView.swift          ← Sidebar list row
    ├── AliasDetailView.swift       ← Detail panel (right side)
    └── AliasFormView.swift         ← Add / Edit form (sheet)
```

### Key Design Decisions

- **Sandbox disabled** — The app needs direct access to `~/.zshrc` in the user's home directory. App Sandbox is turned off in the entitlements file.
- **Non-alias lines preserved** — When saving, the service only modifies the managed alias block. All other `.zshrc` content (exports, PATH, plugins, etc.) is left untouched.
- **Managed block** — Aliases are written under a clearly marked `# Aliases (Managed by AliasManager)` section for easy identification.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `⌘N` | Add new alias |
| `⌘R` | Refresh alias list |
| `Esc` | Cancel / dismiss form |

---

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **On launch**, the app reads `~/.zshrc` and parses all lines matching the `alias name='command'` pattern
2. Commented-out aliases (`# alias name='command'`) are detected as **disabled**
3. Comments directly above an alias line are captured as **descriptions**
4. When you make changes, the app:
   - Rewrites only the alias block in `~/.zshrc`
   - Runs `source ~/.zshrc` to apply changes immediately
   - All non-alias content in your `.zshrc` stays intact

---

## 📦 Import / Export

**Export** your aliases as a JSON file to back them up or share across machines:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "...",
    "name": "gs",
    "command": "git status",
    "isEnabled": true,
    "comment": "Quick git status"
  }
]
```

**Import** a JSON file to merge aliases into your current set. Duplicates (by name) are automatically skipped.
